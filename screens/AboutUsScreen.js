    title: "Color Theory",
    text: "This application employs a color theory that emphasizes balance and user engagement. The primary colors are dark gray, off-white, and teal. Dark gray serves as the background, providing a modern and sleek aesthetic. Off-white is used for text, ensuring readability and a clean look. Teal is the accent color, used sparingly to draw attention to key interactive elements like buttons and links. This color scheme is chosen to foster a sense of professionalism and tranquility, enhancing the user's overall experience."

    title: "60 / 30 / 10 Rule",
    text: "The 60/30/10 rule is a design principle suggesting that 60% of the design should be a dominant color, 30% a secondary color, and 10% an accent color. In this application, the dominant color is dark gray, the secondary color is off-white, and the accent color is teal. This approach ensures a visually engaging and balanced interface, enhancing user interaction and focus."

    title: "Lazy Linking Prototyping",
    text: "Lazy Linking Prototyping is a process of creating a prototype of an application by linking together different components of the application lazily. This means that the components are only loaded when they are needed, which can reduce the amount of time it takes to load the application. This approach can be useful for applications that have many components or that require a lot of data to be loaded. By only loading the components that are needed, the application can load faster and be more efficient. In this application, lazy linking prototyping is used to create a prototype of the application quickly and efficiently, without having to write a lot of code."
